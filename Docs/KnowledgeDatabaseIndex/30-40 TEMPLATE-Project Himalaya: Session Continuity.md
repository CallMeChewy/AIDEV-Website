# Project Himalaya: Session Continuity Document
**Created: March 22, 2025 11:45 AM**

## Current Session Overview

In this session, we established the foundational structure for Project Himalaya through creating comprehensive scope documentation and knowledge database organization. We focused on developing a bottom-up approach to address the growing complexity of the project.

## Key Accomplishments

1. Created comprehensive Project Himalaya scope definition document
2. Designed Project Knowledge Database structure and organization
3. Established a session continuity template (this document)
4. Defined component hierarchy and development sequence
5. Restructured the development approach from top-down to bottom-up

## Current Project Status

### Active Components
- **Project-wide**: Refining scope definition and knowledge structure
- **DocumentManager**: Preliminary planning phase
- **StateManager**: Conceptual design
- **AIDEV-PascalCase**: Standards defined (v1.6), implementation planning

### Development Focus
The current priority is establishing the infrastructure layer, beginning with:
1. DocumentManager - Core document storage and retrieval system
2. StateManager - Session state persistence and management
3. StandardsValidator - Validation against AIDEV-PascalCase standards

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1. Begin detailed design of DocumentManager
   - Define data models
   - Create API specification
   - Plan storage strategy
   - Design metadata schema

2. Establish initial Project Knowledge Database
   - Create directory structure
   - Set up initial README files
   - Migrate existing documentation

3. Refine session continuity process
   - Test this template's effectiveness
   - Create automation for continuity document generation
   - Establish handoff procedures

### Short-Term Goals (1-2 Weeks)
1. Complete DocumentManager MVP implementation
2. Begin StateManager detailed design
3. Set up basic search capabilities for Project Knowledge Database
4. Create templates for all standard project documents

## Reference Information

### Project Structure
The project follows a layered architecture:
1. **Layer 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - DocumentManager
   - StateManager
   - StandardsValidator

2. **Layer 2: Communication Framework**
   - TaskManager
   - AIInterface
   - KnowledgeTransfer

3. **Layer 3: Development Tools**
   - CodeGenerator
   - TestFramework
   - DocumentationGenerator

4. **Layer 4: Applications**
   - OllamaModelEditor
   - AIDEV-Deploy

### Key Documents
- Project Himalaya Scope Definition
- Project Knowledge Database Structure
- AIDEV-PascalCase Standards 1.6
- AI-Human Collaborative Development Process Reference

### Development Principles
- Bottom-up development approach
- Component completion before progression
- Documentation-driven development
- Progressive enhancement
- Regular state persistence

## Technical Considerations

- **RAG Implementation**: Needs to support both document storage and effective retrieval
- **State Persistence**: Must handle unexpected session terminations
- **Standard Enforcement**: Should balance consistency with practical application
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Must facilitate seamless continuation between sessions

*"Code is not merely functional—it is a visual medium that developers interact with for extended periods. The choices made in these standards prioritize the axis of symmetry, character distinction, readability at scale, and visual hierarchy."*
