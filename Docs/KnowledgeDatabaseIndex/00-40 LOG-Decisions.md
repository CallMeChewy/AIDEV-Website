## 1. Decision Log Purpose

This document maintains a chronological record of all significant project decisions, providing:
- Clear documentation of decision rationale
- Traceability for architectural and design choices
- Historical context for future development
- Reference for onboarding new participants

Each decision includes background information, alternatives considered, rationale, and implementation implications.

## 2. Recent Decisions

### DECISION-20250322-1: Bottom-Up Development Approach
**Date**: March 22, 2025
**Decision Maker**: Herbert J. Bowers
**Type**: Architectural/Process

**Context**:
Initial project planning used a top-down approach, starting with applications and working downward. This approach proved challenging due to the complexity of implementing higher-level components without a solid foundation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Continue top-down approach with temporary implementations
2. Switch to bottom-up approach, building foundation first
3. Mixed approach with parallel development streams

**Decision**:
Adopt a strict bottom-up development approach, starting with Layer 1 infrastructure components.

**Rationale**:
- Foundation components can be used to build and test higher layers
- Reduced interdependency issues during development
- More modular and testable architecture
- Allows for iterative refinement of the architecture
- Better supports AI-human collaborative development

**Implementation**:
1. Focus immediate development on DocumentManager
2. Follow with StateManager and StandardsValidator
3. Only begin Layer 2 components after Layer 1 is operational
4. Reorganize project scope [10-20] to reflect new approach

### DECISION-20250322-2: Three-Tier Database Architecture
**Date**: March 22, 2025
**Decision Maker**: Herbert J. Bowers
**Type**: Architectural/Technical

**Context**:
The project requires persistent storage for various components, including documents, state, validation rules, and application data. A clear database architecture is needed to ensure proper data organization and access.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Single database for all components
2. Database per component
3. Three-tier architecture with shared core, project-specific, and user databases
4. Cloud-based solution with remote synchronization

**Decision**:
Implement a three-tier database architecture:
1. Himalaya Core Database (shared across projects)
2. Project-specific databases (e.g., "AIDEV-Validate.db")
3. User-facing help system database

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced complexity for individual components
- Appropriate isolation for project-specific data
- Flexibility for future evolution
- Simplified deployment and management

**Implementation**:
1. Define standard schema for core database [20-50]
2. Create database manager component in Layer 1
3. Establish standard interfaces for database access
4. Implement SQLite for initial implementation

### DECISION-20250322-3: Document Numbering System
**Date**: March 22, 2025
**Decision Maker**: Herbert J. Bowers
**Type**: Process/Administrative

**Context**:
Project documents need a consistent organization system that supports easy navigation, clear categorization, and future expansion.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Simple categorization with descriptive names
2. UUID-based identification
3. Hierarchical numbering system
4. Tag-based organization

**Decision**:
Implement a hierarchical numbering system with series and subseries designations (nn-nn) followed by document type and topic.

**Rationale**:
- Intuitive navigation and organization
- Clear visual identification of document types
- Supports insertion of new documents between existing ones
- Facilitates cross-referencing
- Similar to established systems in technical documentation

**Implementation**:
1. Define standard series numbers (00-90)
2. Establish document types (SPEC, PLAN, etc.)
3. Create document map [00-10]
4. Update existing documents to follow new system

### DECISION-20250322-4: DocumentManager as First Component
**Date**: March 22, 2025
**Decision Maker**: Herbert J. Bowers
**Type**: Implementation/Priority

**Context**:
With the bottom-up approach decided, a starting component needed to be selected that would provide the most foundational capabilities for other components.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. StateManager (for session persistence)
2. DocumentManager (for knowledge storage)
3. StandardsValidator (for ensuring code quality)
4. Parallel implementation of all Layer 1 components

**Decision**:
Implement DocumentManager as the first component, followed by StateManager and StandardsValidator.

**Rationale**:
- DocumentManager provides immediate utility for storing project documentation
- Creates foundation for knowledge management across components
- Relatively self-contained with minimal dependencies
- Can be used to document its own implementation
- Supports RAG capabilities needed by other components

**Implementation**:
1. Complete the DocumentManager specification [50-10]
2. Define database schema for document metadata
3. Implement core storage and retrieval functions
4. Add search and indexing capabilities

## 3. Legacy Decisions

### DECISION-20250320-1: AIDEV-PascalCase as Coding Standard
**Date**: March 20, 2025
**Decision Maker**: Herbert J. Bowers
**Type**: Technical/Standards

**Context**:
A consistent coding standard was needed across the project to ensure readability, maintainability, and a distinctive visual signature.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Standard PEP 8 Python style guide
2. Google Python Style Guide
3. Custom AIDEV-PascalCase standard
4. Mixed approach depending on component

**Decision**:
Adopt AIDEV-PascalCase as the standard coding convention for all Project Himalaya components.

**Rationale**:
- Creates distinctive visual style
- Improves readability with clear word boundaries
- Reduces eye strain compared to snake_case
- Maintains consistency across all components
- Aligns with project creator's preferences and background

**Implementation**:
1. Document the standard in detail [20-10]
2. Create examples and templates
3. Implement validation tools
4. Ensure AI assistants understand and follow the standard
