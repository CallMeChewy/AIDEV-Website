## Project Creator
**Author**: Herbert J. Bowers (Herb@BowersWorld.com)  
**Project**: OllamaModelEditor  
**Standards**: AIDEV-PascalCase-1.2

## Development Approach
This project represents the culmination of decades of design experience and software development practice, combining principles from typography, visual design, and modern programming paradigms.

The unique AIDEV-PascalCase standard employed throughout this codebase reflects both functional considerations and aesthetic principles derived from the author's background in professional typography and print design.

## AI Collaboration Statement
This project was developed through human-AI collaboration. The author maintains full responsibility for the content, design decisions, and standards implementation, while the formalization of documentation and portions of code implementation were enhanced through collaboration with Claude AI (Anthropic).

This collaboration exemplifies a new paradigm in software development where human expertise, creativity, and design philosophy are augmented by AI capabilities without sacrificing the distinctive personal signature of the creator.

## Citation & Use
When referencing this project or its distinctive standards, please include attribution to Herbert J. Bowers and acknowledge the AI-human collaborative methodology employed in its creation.

*"Code is not merely functional—it is a visual medium that developers interact with for extended periods. The choices made in these standards prioritize the axis of symmetry, character distinction, readability at scale, and visual hierarchy."*
