## 1. Test Objectives

This test plan aims to verify that the AIDEV-ProjectSetup application correctly:
- Creates new projects with proper directory structure
- Sets up and configures databases (both Himalaya.db and project-specific)
- Integrates with GitHub repositories
- Provides an intuitive and responsive user interface
- Handles errors gracefully
- Follows all Project Himalaya standards and conventions

## 2. Test Environment Setup

- GitHub Personal Access Token with repo scope

### 2.2 Test Configuration

- Create a `.env` file in the project root with `GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here`
- Backup and then delete any existing Himalaya.db to test fresh creation
- Ensure test directories are empty before each test run

*"Project Himalaya redefines software development by elevating AI to the role of primary implementer while positioning humans as strategic architects. Through rigorous standards, comprehensive testing, and database-driven accountability, we establish a new paradigm where quality, transparency, and continuity are inherent to the process rather than aspirational goals."*
